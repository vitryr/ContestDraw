## GDPR Compliance Guide

### ✅ GDPR-Compliant Tools (EU Hosting)

| Tool | Hosting | DPO | Certificate | Verdict |
|------|---------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Cleack** | 🇫🇷 France (AWS EU) | ✅ Yes | ✅ SHA-256 | ✅ 100% compliant |
| Pickaw | 🇫🇷 France | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Compliant |
| Easypromos | 🇪🇸 Spain | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partially |

---

### ❌ Non-GDPR-Compliant Tools (US Hosting)

| Tool | Hosting | DPO | Certificate | Risk |
|------|---------|-----|-------------|------|
| Woobox | 🇺🇸 USA | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ High risk |
| ViralSweep | 🇺🇸 USA | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ High risk |
| Gleam | 🇺🇸 USA | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ High risk |
| Rafflecopter | 🇺🇸 USA | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ High risk |

**⚠️ Why US Hosting Is Problematic:**

Since the Schrems II decision (2020), data transfers to the US require additional safeguards (SCCs). Many US tools don't comply.

**Risk:** CNIL fine up to €20M or 4% of annual revenue.

1. [ ] **EU Hosting** (European servers)
2. [ ] **Designated DPO** (Data Protection Officer)
3. [ ] **Privacy policy** in your language
4. [ ] **DPA available** (Data Processing Agreement)
5. [ ] **Draw certificates** with timestamps

## FAQ

### Do I need an Instagram Pro account?

Yes, for tools using the Instagram API (like Cleack). It's free and takes 2 clicks in Instagram settings.

### What is GDPR compliance and why is it important?

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) imposes strict rules on collecting and processing personal data in Europe. A non-compliant tool can expose you to fines up to €20M or 4% of revenue.

**Essential GDPR criteria:**
- EU hosting (European servers)
- Designated DPO (Data Protection Officer)
- Certificate and immutable history
- Data deletion rights

**GDPR-compliant tools:** Cleack, Pickaw, Easypromos
**Non-compliant tools:** Woobox, ViralSweep, Gleam (US hosting)

### Are free tools reliable?

Free tools like Comment Picker or Random.org work for **small occasional draws** (<100 participants), but they lack:
- Anti-bot filters (fraud risk)
- Proof certificate
- GDPR compliance
- Customer support

For regular professional use, a paid tool is essential.

### Can I run an Instagram giveaway without a tool?

Yes, but it's **not recommended** for several reasons:
- ⏱️ Very time-consuming (several hours)
- ❌ Human error risk
- 🤖 Impossible to filter bots
- ⚖️ No proof of fairness
- 📋 Not GDPR compliant

**Manual method:**
1. List all participant names in Excel
2. Number each row
3. Use Random.org to generate a random number
4. Announce the winner

**Problem:** No proof, no transparency, and very time-consuming.
