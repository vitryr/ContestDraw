### Press Release

**Title:** Cleack Launches to Revolutionize Instagram Giveaways with AI-Powered Bot Detection and GDPR Compliance

**Draft:**
```
Paris, France – January 15, 2025

Cleack, a new SaaS platform for automated Instagram giveaways, launches today with a mission to make social media contests fair, transparent, and GDPR-compliant.

The platform addresses a critical pain point for influencers and brands: manually selecting winners from hundreds or thousands of comments is time-consuming and prone to fraud.

Key Features:
- Automatic participant retrieval via Instagram API
- Advanced bot detection and fake account filtering
- Story-format video proof (9:16)
- PDF certificate with SHA-256 cryptographic hash
- 100% GDPR compliant (EU hosting, designated DPO)

"We've seen influencers spend hours copy-pasting comments into Excel, only to have participants question the fairness of the draw," says [Founder Name], CEO of Cleack. "Our platform reduces that to 2 minutes while providing cryptographic proof of fairness."

Cleack is available now with a free trial. Pricing starts at €2.49 per draw or €19.99/month for unlimited draws.
