## How Credits Work

ContestDraw uses a **credit-based system** where you pay for what you use:

- ✅ **One-time purchases**: Buy credits when you need them
- ✅ **No expiration**: Credits never expire
- ✅ **Transparent pricing**: Know exactly what each draw costs
- ✅ **Pay per draw**: Only charged when executing draws, not creating them

### Credit Usage

**Credits are deducted when:**
- Executing a contest draw
- Re-executing a draw (if you need to pick new winners)
- Using advanced filters

**Credits are NOT used for:**
- Creating draft draws
- Syncing participants
- Viewing results
- Cancelling draws
- Connecting social accounts
