2. **Simplicity:** Easy to use, hard to misuse

5. **Fairness:** Cryptographically secure draws, verifiable results
6. **Speed:** Fast development cycles, ship early, iterate

## Behind the Roadmap

**How We Prioritize:**

```
Score = (Impact × Votes × Feasibility) / Effort

Impact: How many users benefit? (1-10)
Votes: Community votes (0-1000)
Feasibility: Technical complexity (1-5, higher = easier)
Effort: Engineering time (1-100 days)
```

**Example:**
- Scheduled draws: (9 × 428 × 4) / 15 = 1,029 points → High priority
- Twitch integration: (5 × 87 × 3) / 30 = 43 points → Lower priority

**Factors We Consider:**
- User demand (votes, emails, churn reasons)
- Revenue impact (will it drive conversions?)
- Competitive advantage (do competitors have this?)
- Technical debt (does it require refactoring?)
- Strategic fit (aligns with vision?)

---

## Roadmap Changes

**Updated Quarterly:** Roadmap reviewed and updated every 3 months

**Transparency Commitment:**
- Explain why features are delayed
- Share what we're learning
- Admit when we're wrong
- Celebrate when users are right

**Last Major Update:** January 15, 2025
**Next Review:** April 15, 2025
